# Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning

## Overview
This project explores various ensemble methods in machine learning using the Python scikit-learn library. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve overall performance and robustness. This notebook covers homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble methods, including Bagging, Boosting, Voting, and Stacking. We will use a dataset to predict the `BiodiversityHealthIndex` based on several environmental indicators.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand different ensemble methods and apply them using the scikit-learn library.
- Combine multiple models for enhanced predictions.
- Evaluate and compare the effectiveness of ensemble methods versus single-model approaches.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on this url:
- [SDG 15 Life on Land Dataset]()

## Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required Python packages.
- **ensemble_methods.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code and explanations.

## Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Load and inspect the dataset.
   - Generate summary statistics for numerical features.
   - Visualize the distribution of the `BiodiversityHealthIndex`.
   - Use a pairplot to visualize the relationships between variables.

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Calculate the correlation coefficients between `BiodiversityHealthIndex` and other environmental indicators.
   - Identify the top six variables most closely related to `BiodiversityHealthIndex`.

3. **Homogeneous Ensemble Methods**:
   - **Bagging**: Implement a bagging ensemble using `BaggingRegressor`.
   - **Boosting**: Implement a boosting ensemble using `AdaBoostRegressor`.

4. **Heterogeneous Ensemble Methods**:
   - **Training Individual Models**: Train individual models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Regression).
   - **Voting**: Implement a voting ensemble using `VotingRegressor`.
   - **Stacking**: Implement a stacking ensemble using `StackingRegressor`.

5. **Exercise**:
   - **RandomForestRegressor**: Train a `RandomForestRegressor` and evaluate its performance using R-squared.
   - **GradientBoostingRegressor**: Train a `GradientBoostingRegressor` and evaluate its performance using R-squared.
